# BiG Day In 2019

The enclosed slides and notes were created for a presentation titled "How to do an ICT degree", presented by Mars at the BiG Day In event held in Hobart on the 22nd May 2019. 

*The BiG Day In events are aimed at senior secondary school and university students interested in careers in ICT and technology.  BiG Day In helps students obtain more information about ICT and technology careers, and hopefully helps them make a better-informed decision about their future.
BiG Day In events are held on University campuses around Australia (where possible) to give students an insight into what “university life” might look like.* - BiG Day In Overview, [thebigdayin.com.au](https://www.thebigdayin.com.au)
